Created a simple and responsive web-based Employee Management Portal that supports the following CRUD actions: <br />
a)**Add Employee** : On submitting the form a unique employee-id is generated for the employee and the details are saved in the MongoDB Database using MongoDB Atlas. <br />
b)**Delete Employee** : A delete button feature in the table to delete the details of that employee from the database. <br />
c)**Update Employee** : An update button feature in the table which links to an update employee web-page for re-entry of the details of that user. Changes are saved in the database of that corresponding employee identified by his/her unique employee-id.  <br />
d)**Show all Employee Details**: A table containing all relevant details of all the employees. <br />
e)**Search Employee by the Unique Employee-Id** : To get the details of any specific employee, we've used the unique-id to display his/her details. <br />
